Food Focus - Project #1
A Site that brings in healthy food groups that promote focus, the main ingredient for a novice developer!  ðŸ’»

## Description
This first group project submission, Food Focus, is a website collaboration in which students worked together applying all material learned thus far into a successfully deployed website application.  The students had to implement the usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Local Storage, and APIs in order for the project to be successful.  

This webpage has a main homepage that allows the user to examine three food groups, Vegan, Gluten Free, and Keto.  The end, or footer region of the homepage has a contact section and area in which the user can submit a recommendation.

The three food group pages begin on the home page with an image linking the user to each of their respected pages.  Within each food group subpage, the user will be able to learn about the specific diet and obtain an example receipt. Each page links the user back to the homepage.
